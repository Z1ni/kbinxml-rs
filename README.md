# kbinxml-rs

An encoder/decoder for Konami's binary XML format, used in some of their games.

**WARNING!** Requires Rust Nightly due to the use of the `int_to_from_bytes` unstable feature.

### Setup

- Setup Rust Nightly through `rustup` or your own preferred method of acquiring the nightly version of Rust
- For using `kbinxml-rs` as a library, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file
- For using `kbinxml-rs` as a standalone application, install `kbinxml-rs` using `cargo install kbinxml` (Note: This will not work at the moment as `kbinxml-rs` has not yet been published to [crates.io](https://crates.io))
